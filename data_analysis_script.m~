%% stock market prices since we don't know more details about them (number of sales .. )
%% We think that they more likely represent a stochastic noise (White noise) more than 
%% a real useful process.

%% Here we can see that we obtain an Rsquare = 0.95, which means that our data fits well in a Linear Model
%% We also could have worked on Gaussian processes or Suppose that 
%% stock prices are Markovian or use an SVM classification approach
%% 


%% We can therefore work on a trading strategy : 
%% The predicted change in stock prices will therefore serve to developing a a trading strategy 

%% When we expect that the target stock price is going to increase, 
%% We buy an action (yreg>0)and when we expect that the target stock price
%% is going down in next day we sell 1 action. There our strategy will
%% require a 1 day frequency trading. For the sake of simplicity, we have
%% chosen to just ignore non working days (Without data) because we assume
%% that there are no arbitrage opportunities and that data is quasi-continuous, 
%% , no jumps (belongs to the B&S Model, dXt = (mu_t*dt+sigma_t*dWt)X_t) and a Black
%% and in a such model there no jumps. We also could have used a linear interpolation for the missing
%% but finally we think that a such approach would add no relevant information
%% to our predictive Model. 
%% A such approach can be tested by computing the scalar product between
%% the yreg and the stock prices.
